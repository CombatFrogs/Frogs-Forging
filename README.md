# Frogs-Forging

## About
Customizeable forging mod inspired by the Anvils in [TerraFirmaCraft](http://terrafirmacraft.com/). Allows modpack makers to customize crafting recipes by using a GUI-based forging mini-game, with interactions representing blacksmithing techniques to create items in a somewhat more immersive way.

## Credits
Huge thanks to [McJty](https://github.com/McJty) for their excellent, in depth modding tutorials for Forge on 1.12.2, and also to [Bioxx](https://github.com/Deadrik) and the rest of the TerraFirmaCraft dev. team for the original feature in TFC on 1.7.10.
